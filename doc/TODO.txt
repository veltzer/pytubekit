- implement a single playlist dump which dumps not only
	the ids of the videos but also meta data about them.
- use the dump of lists with details to find out what the problem is with my
	"saw1" playlist which shows that it has unavailable videos in the youtube
	UI even though I clean it up using my "remove_unavailable" feature.
- since we cant download watch later from the api do that using regular
    scraping ideas.
